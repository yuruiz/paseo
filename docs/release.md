# Release

All workspaces share one version and release together.

## Two paths

There are two supported ways to ship from `main`:

1. **Direct stable release**: you are ready to ship the current `main` commit to everyone immediately.
2. **Beta flow**: you want public test builds first, but you are not ready for the website, npm, or production mobile release flows to move yet.

## Standard release (patch)

Before running any stable patch release command:

- Make sure the intended release commit is already committed to `main` and the working tree is clean.
- **Run `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` and commit any resulting changes BEFORE you start any `release:*` command.** `release:check` runs `npm install --workspaces --include-workspace-root` as part of `release:prepare`, which can mutate `package-lock.json` (e.g. churning `"dev": true` markers on optional deps). The next step, `version:all:*`, runs `npm version` which aborts when the working tree is dirty. If this happens mid-flight you have to commit the lockfile churn before retrying — and the pre-commit format hook will reject a lockfile-only commit because oxfmt internally skips `package-lock.json` while lefthook's glob still matches it. Avoid the whole mess by running format/lint/typecheck first, then `release:prepare` once on its own to absorb any lockfile churn into a normal commit, then start the release.
- Do not use `npm run release:patch` as a substitute for checking whether the current commit is actually ready.

```bash
npm run release:patch
```

This bumps the version across all workspaces, runs checks, publishes to npm, and pushes the branch + tag (triggering `Desktop Release`, `Android APK Release`, EAS `release-mobile.yml`, and `Release Notes Sync` workflows).

If asked to "release paseo" without specifying major/minor, treat it as a patch release.

Use the direct stable path when the current `main` changes are ready to become the public release immediately.

## Manual step-by-step

```bash
npm run typecheck            # Verify the exact commit you intend to release
npm run release:check        # Typecheck, build, dry-run pack
npm run version:all:patch    # Bump version, create commit + tag
npm run release:publish      # Publish to npm
npm run release:push         # Push HEAD + tag (triggers CI workflows)
```

## Beta flow

```bash
npm run release:beta:patch       # Bump to X.Y.Z-beta.1, push commit + tag
# ... test desktop and APK prerelease assets from GitHub Releases ...
npm run release:beta:next        # Optional: cut X.Y.Z-beta.2, beta.3, ...
npm run release:promote          # Promote X.Y.Z-beta.N to stable X.Y.Z
```

- Beta tags are published GitHub prereleases like `v0.1.41-beta.1`
- Betas publish desktop assets and APKs for testing, but they do not publish npm packages and do not trigger the production web/mobile release flows
- `release:promote` creates a fresh stable tag like `v0.1.41`; the final release never reuses the beta tag
- Desktop assets now come from the Electron package at `packages/desktop`
- Beta releases use Electron's `beta` update channel. Users on the stable channel only receive stable releases; users on the beta channel receive beta releases and the final stable release when it is published.
- **Do create a changelog entry for betas.** The beta entry is temporary and gets updated in place until promotion.

Use the beta path when you need to:

- test a build manually in a Linux or Windows VM
- send a build to a user who is hitting a specific problem
- iterate on `beta.1`, `beta.2`, `beta.3`, and so on before deciding to ship broadly

## Staged rollout (stable channel)

Stable desktop releases go out via a linear time-based rollout: 0% admitted when the updater manifests appear, 100% admitted 24 hours later, linear ramp in between. Beta releases bypass the rollout entirely — beta users always receive updates immediately.

The rollout is driven by a `rolloutHours` field stamped into the GitHub Release manifests (`latest-mac.yml`, `latest-linux.yml`, `latest.yml`) by the `finalize-rollout` job in `desktop-release.yml`.

Desktop release builds now publish in two phases:

- Platform build jobs upload the installers/packages (`.dmg`, `.zip`, `.exe`, `.AppImage`, etc.) to the GitHub release.
- The final job merges/stamps the manifests and uploads all `.yml` files only after they already contain the final `releaseDate` and `rolloutHours`.

Updater clients only discover a release through those `.yml` manifests, so there is no silent 100% admission window before rollout metadata is present.

### Default behavior

`npm run release:patch` → tag push → 24h ramp. No extra action needed.

The `rollout_hours` input on `desktop-release.yml` is **only read on `workflow_dispatch`** — tag-push runs always default to 24. To get any other rollout duration on a fresh release, use the post-publish flip below.

### Instant-admit release (rollout_hours=0 from publish)

For a fresh release that should admit everyone immediately (low-risk change, doc-only, hotfix, or just a release you want out fast), cut the release normally and queue the rollout flip immediately after:

```bash
# 1. Cut and publish (default 24h ramp from tag push).
npm run release:patch

# 2. Immediately queue the flip — runs as soon as finalize-rollout completes.
gh workflow run desktop-rollout.yml \
  -f tag=v0.1.64 \
  -f rollout_hours=0
```

**Why this is gap-free:** `desktop-release.yml`'s `finalize-rollout` job and `desktop-rollout.yml` share the concurrency group `desktop-rollout-<tag>`. Dispatching `desktop-rollout.yml` while the tag-push pipeline is still running queues it safely behind `finalize-rollout`. The first public manifests already carry `rolloutHours=24`, then `desktop-rollout.yml` flips them to `rolloutHours=0` shortly afterward. The renderer polls every 30 minutes, so active stable users pick up the new manifest on their next check.

Run the dispatch right after `release:patch` returns. Don't wait for the tag-push CI to finish.

### Adjusting an already-published release

To change the rollout duration on a release that's already shipped — e.g. flip a hotfix to instant admit, or slow a release down — use the dedicated `desktop-rollout.yml` workflow. It edits the manifests in place on the GitHub release without rebuilding anything. It only rewrites `rolloutHours`; `releaseDate` is preserved, so the rollout clock keeps ticking from the original publish time.

**Hotfix (instant admit) on an already-shipped release:**

```bash
gh workflow run desktop-rollout.yml \
  -f tag=v0.1.42 \
  -f rollout_hours=0
```

`rollout_hours=0` admits 100% of stable users on their next update check (within ~30 min for active clients).

**Slow a rollout down** (e.g. extend total duration to 72h since the original release):

```bash
gh workflow run desktop-rollout.yml \
  -f tag=v0.1.42 \
  -f rollout_hours=72
```

`rollout_hours` is **total duration since the original release date**, not "extend by N more hours from now." If `v0.1.42` was published 2h ago and you set `rollout_hours=72`, the ramp finishes 70h from now.

The dispatch is idempotent and shares the `desktop-rollout-<tag>` concurrency group with `desktop-release.yml`'s `finalize-rollout` job, so it serializes safely against an in-flight tag-push pipeline targeting the same release.

### Custom ramp on a manually-dispatched build

`desktop-release.yml` accepts `rollout_hours` only on `workflow_dispatch`, which is the path used to **rebuild an existing tag** (retry a failed release, force a rebuild on a different ref). When you go that route, you can stamp a non-default ramp directly:

```bash
gh workflow run desktop-release.yml \
  -f tag=v0.1.43 \
  -f rollout_hours=6
```

This does **not** apply to fresh releases cut via `npm run release:patch` — that path always tag-pushes and stamps 24. For a fresh release with a custom ramp, cut normally and then dispatch `desktop-rollout.yml` (same pattern as the instant-admit flow above, with your chosen `rollout_hours`).

### Releasing during an active rollout

If you ship N+1 while N is still ramping, N+1 starts a fresh rollout from its own publish timestamp. N's rollout effectively ends — the newer manifest supersedes it.

If N+1 is a hotfix for a bug in N, dispatch `desktop-rollout.yml -f tag=v0.1.<N+1> -f rollout_hours=0` after N+1 publishes so the users who already got N reach the fix fast.

### Limitations

- **No pause / kill switch.** Once a stable user is admitted, they will install the update on next quit (`autoInstallOnAppQuit = true`). To stop new admissions, ship a superseding release. To "recall" already-admitted users, ship a hotfix `+1` patch.
- **No rollback.** `allowDowngrade = false`. Bad release = ship a hotfix.
- **Bootstrap caveat.** Clients running a build older than the rollout feature ignore `rolloutHours` and admit immediately. Rollout protection only applies to clients running the rollout-aware version or later.
- **Up to ~30 min admission latency.** Renderer polls every 30 minutes, so a stable user may take up to that long to be evaluated against the rollout window.

## Release notes on GitHub

The GitHub Release body is populated automatically by the `Release Notes Sync` workflow (`.github/workflows/release-notes-sync.yml`). It triggers on every `v*` tag push and on any push to `main` that touches `CHANGELOG.md`, then runs `scripts/sync-release-notes-from-changelog.mjs` to mirror the matching changelog entry into the release body. You don't need to write release notes on GitHub manually — keep `CHANGELOG.md` correct and the workflow will sync it. To force a re-sync, dispatch the workflow with the tag input.

## Website behavior

- The website download page points to GitHub's latest published **stable** release.
- Published beta prereleases are public on GitHub Releases, but they do **not** become the website download target.
- The website only moves when you publish the final stable release tag like `v0.1.41`.
- The website itself is deployed by `Deploy Website` (Cloudflare Workers), which redeploys on `release: published` for non-prerelease releases and on pushes to `main` that touch `CHANGELOG.md` or `packages/website/**`.

## Fixing a failed release build

**NEVER bump the version to fix a build problem.** New versions are reserved for meaningful product changes (features, fixes, improvements). Build/CI failures are fixed on the current version.

**Do not rely on `workflow_dispatch` for tagged code fixes.** The `workflow_dispatch` trigger runs the workflow file from the default branch but checks out the code at the tag ref (`ref: ${{ inputs.tag }}`). That means fixes committed to `main` won't change the tagged source tree being built. `workflow_dispatch` only helps when the fix lives in the workflow file itself.

To retry a failed workflow, **always push a retry tag** on the commit you want to build. Reusing the same tag name is expected: move it with `git tag -f ...` and push it with `--force` so the workflow rebuilds the commit you actually want.

Prefer a tag push over `workflow_dispatch` whenever you are rebuilding release code or release assets.

The retry tag patterns below still work and remain the supported way to rebuild specific release targets:

```bash
# Desktop (all platforms)
git tag -f desktop-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-v0.1.28 --force

# Desktop (single platform)
git tag -f desktop-macos-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-macos-v0.1.28 --force
git tag -f desktop-linux-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-linux-v0.1.28 --force
git tag -f desktop-windows-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-windows-v0.1.28 --force

# Android APK
git tag -f android-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin android-v0.1.28 --force

# Beta
git tag -f v0.1.29-beta.2 HEAD && git push origin v0.1.29-beta.2 --force
```

This ensures the checkout ref matches the actual code on `main` with the fix included.

- `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` rebuilds the full tagged release
- `desktop-vX.Y.Z` rebuilds desktop for all desktop platforms only
- `desktop-macos-vX.Y.Z`, `desktop-linux-vX.Y.Z`, and `desktop-windows-vX.Y.Z` rebuild only that desktop platform
- `android-vX.Y.Z` rebuilds the Android APK release only

## Notes

- `version:all:*` bumps root + syncs workspace versions and `@getpaseo/*` dependency versions
- `release:prepare` refreshes workspace `node_modules` links to prevent stale types
- `npm run dev:desktop` and `npm run build:desktop` target the Electron desktop package in `packages/desktop`
- If `release:publish` partially fails, re-run it — npm skips already-published versions
- The website uses GitHub's latest published release API for download links, so published beta prereleases do not replace the stable download target.

## Changelog format

Release notes depend on the changelog heading format. The heading **must** be strictly followed:

```
## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD
## X.Y.Z-beta.N - YYYY-MM-DD
```

No prefix (`v`), no extra text. The parser matches the first `## X.Y.Z` line to extract the version. A malformed heading will break download links on the homepage.

## Changelog policy

- `CHANGELOG.md` includes stable releases and the current beta line.
- The first beta inserts a top entry like `## 0.1.60-beta.1 - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The next beta updates that same top entry in place, for example from `0.1.60-beta.1` to `0.1.60-beta.2`.
- Stable promotion updates that same entry in place, for example from `0.1.60-beta.2` to `0.1.60`.
- Do not create duplicate entries for each beta on the same version line.

## Changelog ownership

- **Only Claude should write changelog entries.**
- If you are Codex and a stable release needs a changelog entry, launch a Claude agent with Paseo to draft it, then review and commit the result.

## Changelog voice

The changelog is shown on the Paseo homepage. Write it for **end users**, not developers.

- **Frame everything from the user's perspective.** Describe what changed in the app, not what changed in the code. Users care that "workspaces load instantly" — not that a component no longer remounts.
- **Never mention component names, internal modules, or implementation details.** No `WorkingIndicator`, no `accumulatedUsage`, no `reconcileAndEmitWorkspaceUpdates`.
- **Collapse internal iterations.** If a feature was added and then fixed within the same release, just list the feature as working. Users never saw the broken version.
- **Only list changes relative to the previous stable release.** The diff is `v(previous)..HEAD`. If something was introduced and fixed between those two tags, it never shipped — don't mention the fix.
  - **Common trap:** when drafting from `git log`, every commit looks like a separate bullet — including the "fix X" commits that landed on top of a brand-new feature in the same release window. Before listing a Fixed entry, check whether the thing being fixed was itself added in this same release. If so, drop the fix and fold it into the feature bullet.
  - **Example:** if the release adds an in-app browser and also contains a commit "fix: browser pane keyboard handling no longer steals shortcuts", do **not** list the keyboard fix under Fixed. The browser is shipping for the first time, so users will only ever see the working version. The Added entry covers it.
- **Cut low-signal entries.** "Toolbar buttons have consistent sizing" is too granular. Combine small polish items or drop them.

## Changelog conciseness

Every bullet must be scannable at a glance. The changelog is not release documentation — it's a list.

- **One line per bullet.** If a bullet wraps to three lines in a narrow column, it's too long.
- **Split bullets that pack multiple distinct changes.** If a bullet uses "and", "plus", a comma list, or an em-dash to chain several independent improvements, break them into separate bullets — even when they share a theme or author. One bullet = one user-facing change.
- **Trim qualifying clauses.** Drop "with a hint shown when…", "matching the CLI's behaviour", "across common install shapes". If the detail doesn't change whether a user cares, cut it.
- **Lead with the outcome.** "Windows: agents launch reliably from npm `.cmd` shims…" is better than "Windows: agents launch reliably across common install shapes. Claude, Codex, and OpenCode now start correctly…".
- **Attribution follows the split.** When you split a dense bullet, move each PR/author to the bullet it belongs to. Never duplicate the same PR across multiple bullets.

## Changelog attribution

Every changelog bullet must credit contributors and link to the PR(s) that delivered the change. This is not one-PR-per-line — a single bullet describes a user-facing change and may reference multiple PRs.

Format: append `([#123](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/123) by [@user](https://github.com/user))` at the end of each bullet. For changes spanning multiple PRs or contributors:

```markdown
- Voice mode now works on tablets with proper microphone permissions. ([#210](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/210), [#215](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/215) by [@alice](https://github.com/alice), [@bob](https://github.com/bob))
```

Rules:

- **Always link the PR number** as `[#N](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/N)`.
- **Always link the contributor's GitHub profile** as `[@user](https://github.com/user)`.
- **One bullet = one user-facing change**, regardless of how many PRs went into it. Group related PRs on the same bullet.
- **De-duplicate contributors.** If the same person authored multiple PRs in one bullet, list them once.
- **Only credit external contributors.** Skip attribution for [@boudra](https://github.com/boudra). The changelog credits community contributions — core team work is the default.
- **Credit the commit author, not the PR opener.** A maintainer often opens a PR that lands work authored by someone else (cherry-pick, rebase of a contributor's branch, manual extraction from a stacked PR). The squash commit preserves the original commit's author, but `gh pr view N --json author` returns the PR opener — using that field will silently mis-credit the work to the maintainer (and then the "skip @boudra" rule drops the attribution entirely). Always resolve attribution from commit authors.

  Use this command to get the GitHub logins for each PR:

  ```bash
  gh pr view N --json commits --jq '[.commits[].authors[].login] | unique | .[]'
  ```

  This returns every distinct GitHub login that authored or co-authored a commit in the PR. Use those logins for attribution. Fall back to `gh pr view N --json author` only if the commits command returns nothing (which should not happen for merged PRs).

  When listing PR numbers, `git log --format='%H %s' v<previous>..HEAD | grep -E '\(#[0-9]+\)$'` pulls the PR number out of squash commit subjects.

## Changelog ordering

Entries within each section (Added, Improved, Fixed) are ordered by user impact:

1. **User-facing features and changes first** — things users will notice, want to try, or that change their workflow.
2. **Quality-of-life improvements** — polish, performance, smoother interactions.
3. **Internal/infra changes last** — only include if they have a tangible user benefit (e.g. "faster startup" is user-facing even if the fix was internal).

## Pre-release sanity check

Before cutting any release (beta or stable), run a Codex review of the diff as a last line of defence against shipping bugs.

Load the `paseo` skill and launch a **Codex 5.4** agent with a prompt like:

> Review the diff between the latest release tag and HEAD. Focus on:
>
> 1. **Breaking changes** — especially in the WebSocket protocol, agent lifecycle, and any server↔client contract.
> 2. **Backward compatibility** — the important direction is old app clients talking to newly updated daemons. Users update desktop and daemon first, then keep running the old app for a while. Flag anything that breaks old clients against new daemons or requires both sides to update in lockstep.
> 3. **Regressions** — anything that looks like it could break existing functionality.
>
> Diff: `git diff <latest-release-tag>..HEAD`

The agent's job is a deep sanity check, not a full code review. If it flags anything, investigate before proceeding.

## Changelog scope

The changelog always covers **stable-to-HEAD**:

- **Beta release**: the diff and release notes cover `latest stable tag -> HEAD`. The current beta changelog entry is updated in place.
- **Stable release**: the same changelog entry is promoted in place. It still captures the full delta from the previous stable release, not just what changed since the last beta.

In other words, betas are checkpoints along the way; the changelog entry remains the single record for the final jump from one stable version to the next.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Run the pre-release sanity check (see above) and address any findings
- [ ] Ensure the intended release commit is already committed and the git worktree is clean before running any `release:*` patch/promote command
- [ ] Ensure local `npm run typecheck` passes on that exact commit before running any `release:*` patch/promote command
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user-facing release notes (features, fixes — not refactors)
- [ ] Verify the changelog heading follows strict `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` format
- [ ] `npm run release:patch` or `npm run release:promote` completes successfully
- [ ] GitHub `Desktop Release` workflow for the `v*` tag is green
- [ ] GitHub `Android APK Release` workflow for the same tag is green
- [ ] EAS `release-mobile.yml` workflow for the same tag is green
